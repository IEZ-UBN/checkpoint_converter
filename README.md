# Checkpoint converter
Fiji [1] macro that converts any image stack to a Stratovan Checkpoint [2] file (*.ckpt) with optional down-scaling of the data.

Work in progress: In its current stage, the converter contains many options only important to our working group. Within the next few days, this will change so it is more user-friendly for the public.

Please cite the following paper when you use this macro:

Rühr et al. (in rev.): Juvenile ecology drives adult morphology in two insect orders.
